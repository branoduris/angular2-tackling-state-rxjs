# Angular2RxJS

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.19-3.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Why I made This

After reading the article 'Tackling State' by Victor Savkin, I really wanted to implement the solution he described myself and see how it actually looks and feels.
